# ABOUT PROJECT

## Customer Retention - Churn analysis

This Analysis is carried out during my Virtual Case Experience with PwC Switzerland. During this experience, I defined proper KPIs, created a dashboard for the retention manager reflecting the KPIs, and wrote a short email to him (the engagement partner) explaining my findings, and included suggestions as to what needs to be changed.


# CASE STUDY

### Background Information
Still in a hypothetical situation, a few weeks after presenting my dashboard to the management, the Retention Manager from the telecom reaches out to me directly. He was impressed by my work and asked if I can put together a dashboard about customer retention by defining proper KPIs, create a dashboard reflecting the KPIs, and write a short email to him explaining my findings, and include suggestions as to what needs to be changed


# DEFINING KPIs

I defined possible KPIs to get me started which include, but not limited to:

i. Customers who left within the last month.

ii. Services each customer has signed up for: phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies. 

iii. Customer account information: how long as a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, total charges and number of tickets opened in the categories administrative and technical. 

iv. Demographic info about customers â€“ gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents

The business has a significant number of loyal customers, with 5,174 out of a total of 7,043 customers. However, there were also 1,869 churned customers, which represents a churn rate of 26.5%. This indicates a potential area for improvement in customer retention strategies to reduce churn and retain more customers in the long run.
Despite the churn rate, the business generated a revenue of 16M, which suggests that loyal customers may be a significant source of revenue for the business. It is important to focus on retaining these customers while also exploring strategies to attract new customers.
In terms of customer support, the business received a total of 3,632 administrative tickets and 2,955 technical tickets. These figures can provide insights into the types of issues customers are experiencing and can guide resource allocation and training efforts for customer support agents.
Overall, a focus on customer retention and support can help the business maintain and grow its revenue, while reducing churn and improving customer satisfaction.

### Fig 2: Tenure by Contract

The data shows that customers with two year contracts had the highest number of tenures at 96,166, followed by customers with Month-to-month contracts at 69,892 tenures and One year contracts at 61,932 tenures. This suggests that customers who commit to longer-term contracts are more likely to stay with the business over an extended period.
Furthermore, the significant difference between the number of customers with two year contracts and those with One year contracts indicates that the business may want to consider strategies to encourage customers to choose longer-term contracts. These strategies may include offering discounts or incentives for customers who commit to a longer contract period.
It is also worth noting that customers with Month-to-month contracts had a relatively high number of tenures, indicating that there may be value in offering more flexible contract options for customers who prefer short-term commitments. By providing a range of contract options, the business may be better able to meet the diverse needs and preferences of its customers.

### Fig 3: Churned and Loyal Customers by Payment Method

The chart shows that Electronic check payment method had the highest number of churned customers at 1,071, which was significantly higher than the credit card (automatic) payment method with the lowest number of churned customers at 232. This highlights the importance of payment method options and how they can impact customer retention.
Furthermore, it is interesting to note that across all four payment methods, the range of churned customers was relatively narrow, ranging from 232 to 1,071. In contrast, the range of loyal customers was even narrower, ranging from 1,286 to 1,304. This suggests that the differences in payment methods may not be the only factor contributing to customer retention.
Overall, these insights suggest that payment methods are an important consideration for businesses looking to improve customer retention. By offering a variety of payment options and ensuring a seamless payment experience, businesses can potentially reduce the number of churned customers and increase customer loyalty.

The analysis indicates that customers without online security, backup, tech support, or device protection are the most likely to churn. This highlights the importance of providing comprehensive support services to customers, as those who feel unsupported may be more likely to switch to a competitor.


# CONCLUSION

Based on the insights, it is evident that customer retention is a crucial area that the business should focus on to maintain and grow its revenue. The business has a significant number of loyal customers, but there are still churned customers, indicating the need for improved retention strategies. The data also shows that customers who commit to longer-term contracts are more likely to stay with the business, highlighting the importance of offering flexible contract options.

Furthermore, payment methods and support services are other factors that can impact customer retention. The business should consider offering a variety of payment options to ensure a seamless payment experience, while also providing comprehensive support services to customers, especially those without online security, backup, tech support, or device protection.

Overall, these insights provide valuable information that can guide the business in developing and implementing effective strategies to improve customer retention, satisfaction, and ultimately, revenue growth.
