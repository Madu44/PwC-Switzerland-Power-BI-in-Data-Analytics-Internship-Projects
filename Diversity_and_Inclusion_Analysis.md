## Diversity and Inclusion - Gender Balance in the Executive Suit

This Analysis is carried out during my Virtual Case Experience with PwC Switzerland. During this experience, I defined relevant KPIs in hiring, promotion, performance and turnover, and created a visualisation.

# CASE STUDY

## Background Information
In a hypothetical situation, a few weeks after presenting my dashboard to the management, the Human Resources at our telecom client is highly into diversity and inclusion. They’ve been working hard to improve gender balance at the executive management level, but they’re not seeing any progress. They’re reaching out to us for help to defined relevant KPIs in hiring, promotion, performance and turnover, and created a visualization and also note down what I think some root causes of their slow progress might be.

# DEFINING KPIs

I calculated the following measures which helped me to define proper KPIs:

Number of men
Number of women
Number of leavers
% employees promoted (FY21)
% of women promoted
% of hires men
% of hires women
% turnover 
Average performance rating: men
Average Performance rating: women

I now defined possible KPIs to get me started which include;

i. Recruitment/Hiring Figures 
ii. Promotion Figures 
iii. Representation Figures 
iv. Employee Diversity Figures
v. Demographic Figures 
vi. Performance Ratings
