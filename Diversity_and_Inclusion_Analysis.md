# ABOUT PROJECT

## Diversity and Inclusion - Gender Balance in the Executive Suit

This Analysis is carried out during my Virtual Case Experience with PwC Switzerland. During this experience, I defined relevant KPIs in hiring, promotion, performance and turnover, and created a visualisation.

# CASE STUDY

## Background Information
In a hypothetical situation, a few weeks after presenting my dashboard to the management, the Human Resources at our telecom client is highly into diversity and inclusion. They’ve been working hard to improve gender balance at the executive management level, but they’re not seeing any progress. They’re reaching out to us for help to defined relevant KPIs in hiring, promotion, performance and turnover, and created a visualization and also note down what I think some root causes of their slow progress might be.

# DEFINING KPIs

I calculated the following measures which helped me to define proper KPIs:
Number of men
Number of women
Number of leavers
% employees promoted (FY21)
% of women promoted
% of hires men
% of hires women
% turnover 
Average performance rating: men
Average Performance rating: women

I now defined possible KPIs to get me started which include;

i. Recruitment/Hiring Figures 
ii. Promotion Figures 
iii. Representation Figures 
iv. Employee Diversity Figures
v. Demographic Figures 
vi. Performance Ratings

# FINDINGS

### Fig 1: Measures

The organization had a total of 500 employees, with 295 men and 205 women. This gender breakdown highlights the potential for gender diversity initiatives within the organization.
Over the course of the reporting period, 87 employees were promoted, indicating that there are opportunities for career advancement within the organization. However, 47 employees left the organization, indicating that retention may be an area for improvement.
Additionally, the fact that 66 employees were newly hired suggests that the organization is actively recruiting and seeking to expand its workforce. It may be worth considering the effectiveness of recruitment strategies and whether they are attracting a diverse pool of candidates.


### Fig 2: Gender Trend

The number of women employees in the organization increased significantly by 325%, from 2014 to 2020 rising from 8 in 2014 to 34 in 2020. This upward trend suggests that the organization may be making strides towards gender diversity and inclusivity in its hiring practices.
However, despite the significant increase in women employees, it is important to monitor and address any potential gender disparities in terms of promotions, pay, and other opportunities within the organization. By actively promoting gender diversity and inclusivity, the organization may be able to attract and retain talented employees from diverse backgrounds, which can ultimately benefit the organization as a whole.


### Fig 3: Promotion by Job Level

In FY21, the number of promotions was highest for the Senior Officer job level at 18, with Manager and Senior Manager following closely behind. This suggests that the organization is prioritizing promotions for employees in these higher-level positions. It may be worthwhile to assess the performance and potential of employees at other job levels to ensure equitable opportunities for career advancement.
Additionally, it is worth noting that promotions in FY21 ranged from 4 to 18 across all five job levels, indicating that there may be disparities in the distribution of promotion opportunities. Identifying any patterns or trends in these promotions, such as demographic characteristics or performance metrics, can help the organization to better understand and address any potential inequalities in its promotion practices.


### Tab 1: Job Level After FY21 and FY20 by Gender

After the FY21, there was a significant disparity between the number of males and females promoted to executive level positions. Out of a total of 9 employees promoted to executive level, only 1 was female while 8 were male. This highlights a potential gender bias in the organization's promotion policies and practices, which could have negative implications for diversity, equity, and inclusion within the company.
It is important for the organization to investigate the reasons behind this disparity and take corrective measures to ensure that promotion decisions are based solely on merit and not influenced by gender or any other demographic characteristic. Strategies such as setting diversity targets, establishing mentorship programs, and providing unconscious bias training for managers could help address this issue and promote a more inclusive workplace culture.

### Fig 4: Hired Employees by Age

Among newly hired employees, the age groups of 20-29 and 30-39 had the highest number of hires, suggesting that the organization may be targeting younger professionals and mid-career individuals for recruitment. On the other hand, the age group of 50-59 had the lowest number of newly hired employees, which could be due to a number of factors such as retirement or a lack of emphasis on hiring older workers. Additional data on the distribution of age groups among existing employees and the organization's overall recruitment strategies could provide further insights into workforce demographics and potential opportunities for diversity and inclusion.


# CONCLUSION

In conclusion, these insights provide a holistic view of the organization's workforce and suggest potential areas for improvement in terms of diversity, equity, and inclusion. The organization's gender breakdown shows the need for gender diversity initiatives, and the significant increase in women employees highlights the potential for progress in this area. However, the organization needs to address potential disparities in promotions, particularly at the executive level, to ensure equal opportunities for all employees.

The organization's high number of promotions suggests that there are opportunities for career advancement, but the disparities in promotion opportunities across job levels and potentially by demographic characteristics need to be addressed. Additionally, the high number of newly hired employees in the younger age groups suggests that the organization may need to consider recruitment strategies to attract diverse candidates from all age groups.

Overall, addressing these issues can contribute to a more inclusive workplace culture, attract and retain talented employees from diverse backgrounds, and ultimately benefit the organization as a whole.
