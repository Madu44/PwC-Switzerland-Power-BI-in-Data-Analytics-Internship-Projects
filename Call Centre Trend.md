# ABOUT PROJECT

### Call Centre Trend Analysis - Visualizing Customer And agent behaviour
This Analysis is carried out during my Internship with PwC Switzerland. During this experience, I created a dashboard in Power BI for a client that reflects all relevant Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and metrics in the dataset.

## CASE STUDY
### Background Information
In a hypothetical situation, I have been tasked to create a dashboard in Power BI for Claire that reflects all relevant Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and metrics in the dataset >>> can be found here

Below was the email I got from a client at PhoneNow requesting for transparency and insight into their data at the Call Centre

# DEFINING KPIs
I defined possible KPIs to get me started which include, but not limited to:

i. Overall customer satisfaction

ii. Overall calls answered & abandoned

iii. Calls by time

iv. Average speed of answer

v. Agentâ€™s performance quadrant -> average handle time (talk duration) vs calls answered


# FINDINGS
#### Fig 1: Measures

![Metrics](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/127628021/227235692-07bb3c9d-32fa-47e4-b913-3725ba374263.png)

The business received a total of 5,000 calls, out of which 4,054 calls were successfully answered by the call agents, and 946 calls were abandoned, indicating a potential area of improvement in call handling or wait times.
On average, customers gave a satisfaction rating of 3.40, which may suggest that there is room for improvement in meeting customer needs and expectations. Additionally, the average speed of call answer was 67.52 seconds, which is a key performance indicator for call centers and may impact customer satisfaction.
It is important to note that the satisfaction rating and speed of call answer are interdependent, and addressing one metric may improve the other. For example, improving the speed of call answer may lead to increased customer satisfaction, as long wait times can lead to frustration and dissatisfaction. Similarly, increasing customer satisfaction may lead to a higher likelihood of customers staying on the line and waiting for an agent to answer their call.
Overall, these metrics provide valuable insights into the performance of the call center and can guide improvements to better meet customer needs and expectations.

### Fig 2: Resolved Vs not Resolved Calls

In terms of the number of resolved topics, Streaming and Technical Support emerge as the top two categories. However, while Technical Support has the highest number of unresolved issues, Contract-related topics have the lowest number of resolved issues, with only 709 issues resolved.
This suggests that while Streaming and Technical Support are relatively well-resourced and effective at resolving customer issues, Contract-related topics may require more attention and resources to improve customer satisfaction. Additionally, the high number of unresolved technical support issues may indicate a need for more robust technical support services or improvements in the effectiveness of existing support channels.

### Fig 3: Total Calls By Month

![Total Calls by month](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/127628021/227240107-80eeb208-af7d-492e-8431-e40f3c28de19.png)

Out of all the months, January had the highest number of calls made with a total of 1,772, followed by February with 1,616 calls and March with 1,612 calls. Interestingly, January alone accounted for 35.44% of all the calls made over the entire period.
This indicates that January was a particularly busy period, potentially due to specific events or circumstances such as holidays or seasonal changes. It is worth investigating why January had such a high call volume, and if there are any patterns or trends that could help better allocate resources in the future. Additionally, the relatively high number of calls made in February and March suggest that these months also require careful monitoring and attention to ensure customer satisfaction.

### Tab 1: Agents Score

The call center employs a total of eight agents to answer customer calls. Among these agents, Diane has the highest percentage of answered calls at 126%, which is significantly higher than the agent with the lowest percentage of answered calls, Dan, who had only 121% of calls answered.
Diane's high percentage of answered calls indicates that she is highly effective and efficient in handling customer inquiries, which is a valuable asset for the call center. Conversely, Dan's lower percentage of answered calls may be an area for improvement, as he may benefit from additional training or support to better address customer needs.
Overall, the performance of the call agents can have a significant impact on customer satisfaction and the success of the call center, and it is essential to regularly monitor and address any areas of concern.


# CONCLUSION

In conclusion, the insights provide valuable information about the performance of the call center and its agents. The data shows that while the call center received a total of 5,000 calls, there is room for improvement in call handling and wait times as 946 calls were abandoned. The average customer satisfaction rating of 3.40 and average speed of call answer of 67.52 seconds suggest that the call center may need to focus on improving customer satisfaction.
The insights also highlight the importance of call agent performance, with Diane standing out as the most effective agent, and Dan's lower percentage of answered calls indicating an area for improvement. Additionally, the insights demonstrate that January had the highest number of calls made, potentially requiring additional resources to manage the high volume.
Finally, the data indicates that Streaming and Technical Support are relatively effective in resolving customer issues, but Contract-related topics require more attention and resources. Overall, the insights provide valuable guidance for the call center to improve customer satisfaction and better meet customer needs and expectations.
